# sql-example1
sql example 1 - This is a basic example that shows how to use mysql.connector to connect to your database and create a table. In this example we create a table named "person" with two columns: Name and Last Name. The Name is chosen to be char (strange assumption just for this example) so a fixed-length string and Last Name is chose to be varchar so a variable-length string.
